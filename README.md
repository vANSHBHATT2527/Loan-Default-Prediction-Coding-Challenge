# Data Science Coding Challenge: Loan Default Prediction 🚀

Welcome to my project submission for the Data Science Coding Challenge organized by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)! In this challenge, we tackled a prevalent machine learning problem in the financial industry - predicting loan defaulters.


## 🚗 My Journey 
Embarking on my first online data science challenge was a thrilling journey into real-world data and model building, proving to be much more than a competition – it was a pivotal learning experience in my data science trajectory.

I am deeply passionate about continuous learning and am excited about the prospect of participating in future challenges! 🚀 My goal is to tackle more data science, and machine learning problems, explore various challenges, and continuously sharpen my skills.

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

Financial institutions globally leverage loan services across various industries. One pivotal objective is to mitigate payment defaults and ensure consistent loan repayments. This is often achieved by employing machine learning models to predict potential defaulters, enabling efficient resource allocation and targeted interventions.

In this challenge, we dealt with the loan default prediction problem on a unique and intriguing dataset from individuals who availed financial loans in 2021. The goal was to build a model that could predict the likelihood of an individual defaulting on their loan payments, thus aiding the financial institution in effectively allocating resources and support to these borrowers.
